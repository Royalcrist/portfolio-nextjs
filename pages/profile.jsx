						Since I was a child I have been curious about the technological
						world and I've loved it from the first moment I discovered it. So
						when I was around 8 years old, I decided to start learning about
						computer science and design. Since then I haven't stopped learning.
						<br />
						<br />
						At 12 I started programming and at 14 I started designing, facts
						that have changed my life forever. Best of all, I love both worlds,
						because incurring both allows me to be in all stages of the product;
						from birth to deployment.
						<br />
						<br />
						As I always liked to create things that solve problems in my day to
						day, when I learned to develop software it was like magic, suddenly
						all those creations that I had in my mind could make them come
						alive.
						<br />
						<br />
						Besides, the fact that someone has positively influenced one of the
						solutions I created motivates me to continue giving my best and
						never stop innovating.
